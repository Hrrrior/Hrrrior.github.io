                <h3>History/Major Historic events: (WILL GET OVERHAUL TO FIT THE NEW WORLD MAP)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current year: The third era - 500 After the Great Meteor Shower (AMS500)</li>
                        <li>(AMS0) 500 years ago a meteor shower hit the better half of the civilized world. Much of history and some of the greatest buildings, forests and monunuments that ever existed, were wiped from the earth in an instant. </li>
                        <li>(AMS332) Despite not having fully recovered from the event, many explorers went out into the world to discover places that had not been destoyed by the tragedy</li>
                        <li>(AMS334) Monster appearances had reached an all time high in 100 years. Hutings monsters, beasts and other abberations became a well respected job.</li>
                        <li>(AMS335) Explorers discovered a brand new continent. Made contact with the cat folk inhabitants.</li>
                        <li>(AMS337) A human empire attempts to conquer the new world.</li>
                        <li>(AMS339) Despite having a bigger army and more advanced technology, the humans lose and are forced to surrender.</li>
                        <li>(AMS345) The cat tribes form an empire and are recognized as an independant nation.</li>
                        <li>(AMS395 - AMS399) A great plague known as the "Arcane Pain"(WIP) sweeps the world and erradicates 93% percent of all (pure) magic users.</li>
                        <li>(AMS407) With the ever growing monster threat, 5 of the most well known and strongest Hunter families/clans band together to create a Global Organization to battle evil. </li>
                        <li>(AMS460) Technology makes great advances. Organization cuts down threats in all over world. </li>
                        <li>(AMS465) With declining monster number also the need for hunters becomes lower. The power of the steam engine is a scientifc revolution.</li>
                        <li>(AMS476) A conflic arises between two neighboring nations and a domino effect causes the entire world to become involved. This later becomes known as the Global War.</li>
                        <li>(AMS477) Many Hunters leave the Organization to go fight for their countries. The Organization HQ is located in a neutral zone however the war makes traveling the world difficult, but monster sightings do no rise as a result.</li>
                        <li>(AMS483) The Global War finally ends. Much of the world has once more been destroyed.</li>
                        <li>(AMS490) 7 years after the Global War ended. The light bulb is invented.</li>
                        <li>(AMS500) For 3 years monster sigtings have been rapitly increasing again and the Organization is looking for new recruits.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Religion:</h3>
                    <h5>Religions: (TBD)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 major monotheistic religions</li>
                        <li>2 major polytheistic religion</li>
                        <li>12ish notworthy minor religions</li>
                        <li>3 noteworthy cults</li>
                        <li>Hundreds of folk religions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Deity:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mortal Demigods: (about a dozen pop up every year around the globe but most end up getting killed)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mortal with enormous spiritual power. Usually either gain power from people praying to them, performing forgotten rituals or consuming the flesh of a stronger god or demigod. Sometimes cult leaders. Usually reside on earth but can ascend and become immortals by increasing their spiritual power (e.g. eating an entire immortal demigod would probably turn you into one as well).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Immortal Demigods: (new one appears once every decade or so)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Former mortal Demigods that ascended into the spiritual plane but cannot send spiritual energy to others or interact with higher tier gods. Can return to the physical plane and can also be killed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Fakegod: Main religious gods (true origin forgotten, most gods of major religions have been around for at least a millenium)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Former mortal: Immortal demigods whose spiritual power grew exponentially because of a religion based on them. At this point they generally stop thinking and their existence revolves around taking and giving spiritual power. Very difficult to return to a physical body.</li>
                                <li>Wished into existence: Giant mass of spiritual energy that started existing because there were enough people who believed in it. For the most part it would be almost impossible to gain a physical body.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Primordial: The first of the mortal and immortal races (believed to be a myth, number unknown)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Among the first of all the sentient races. People who reached the spiritual realm while managing to retain sentience and the ability to freely return to the physical plane. Don't need to be believed in to retain their power. Only have some small and obscure religions dedicated to them.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Great Ones: ??? (???)
                            <ul>
                                <li>???</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Devils:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demidevils: (Hide among the general populus. Thought to be just some type of monster. Atempt to charm, scam or swindle people into signing over their soul.)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Former mortal Demigods that descended into the infernal plane. Due to risk of turning into a demon if their spiritual power should decline to a certain point, they constantly try to trick mortals into giving away their souls. Can return to the physical plane and can also be killed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Devils: (Appear before people in despair to try and trick them into signing their souls. Most religions see them as the direct enemies of their god.)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Former Demidevils: No longer at risk of turning into a demon, they still constantly try to trick mortals into giving away their souls. By gaining power and retaining their mortal desires, their motives and ambitions become increasingly more evil. Can return to the physical plane and can also be killed.</li>
                                <li>Feared into existence:  Either from peoples fear and despair or from a bloodbath with many dead devils. Somewhere in the infernal plane a mass of energy pops into existence. Despite never having been a mortal, they acquire some of their most twisted desires. Can return to the physical plane, but difficult to kill.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Archdevils: (From a mortal standpoint not overly distinguishable from devils. Sometimes force weak willed people to do things without having to appear in front of them.)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Former Devils: Rulers of the infernal realm. No longer waste time on getting mortal souls. If necessary they consume the souls of other devils or even gods. Occasionally desire to cause mischief in the physical plane by putting thoughts into peoples heads. Hard to return to the physical realm. Can only be killed by a Fakegod, Primordial, Great One or the combined power of 66 devils.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
