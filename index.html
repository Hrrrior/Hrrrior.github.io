                <br> Hunters are people who have dedicated their lives to hunting any kind evil in the world.
                Like most people, Hunter range from genuinely good people to those who think any means justify the result.
                There are different stages to being a hunter
                <ul>
                    <li>Stage 1 (Rookie): After basic training, which lasts for 4-5 months and includes everything from theory to basic survival, rookies are usually part of 20-25 person squads that deal with the most common and weak types of filth. Those, who show promise, are usually promoted to Fellows withing the first 6-12 months of being in a squad.</li>
                    <li>Stage 2 (Fellow): Fellow hunters are placed into a group of 3 who all work under a Master Hunter. The master hunters job is to train the Fellows by taking them to more dangerous missions. Once the Master Hunter decides that a hunter is ready. The Fellow is sent on a mission with a party of 3-5 other Fellows.</li>
                    <li>Stage 3 (Good): After a fellow succeeds in their mission. They become a Good Hunter. Good Hunters hunt in a group of 3-5 people and take on medium threats.</li>
                    <li>Stage 4 (Master): After serving as a Good Hunter for at least 3 years and becoming noticed for strength or great deeds, a Good Hunter can be offered to become a Master Hunter, who then starts training Fellows.</li>
                    <li>Stage 4 (Great): Good Hunters, that either decline the offer of being a Master or for some other reason weren't fit for teaching.Great Hunters sometimes hunt alone, sometimes with a group.</li>
                    <li>Stage 5 : ???</li>
                    <li>Stage 6 : ???</li>
